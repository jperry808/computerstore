# ICS 211 Computer Store

This project was created as a way to demonstrate proficiency in object oriented programming in Java. Some things that we had to implement for this assignment are input verification, throwing exceptions, and having the code continue despite any errors or faulty input.

While the project in itself was not relatively hard, the hardships came in all the tiny errors we had to be wary of and make sure that our code catches the errors or does not allow them.

Some of the input validation included:

- Barcode must be from 10001 - 99999
- OS must be 1-3 (1 being Windows, 2 being MacOS and 3 being Linux)
- Price must be from 50-25000
- Barcodes cannot be duplicate
- Must delete computer objects by the barcode

It was challenging at first but this project taught me a lot about how to check if your code is foolproof and to make sure nobody can mess up your code no matter how hard they try.
